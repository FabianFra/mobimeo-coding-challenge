# Mobimeo-Coding-Challenge

---------------------------
This is my solution for the Mobimeo coding challenge for Backend Enginner (Scala).

Thanks again for the opportunity to show my skills. The task was quite fun and I have learned a lot about Scala and Akka!

## Structure

----------------------------

*src/main/scala*:
 * model: Model entities and dtos
 * repository: Repository classes for entities which mock db queries
 * resources: Includes the provided data as .csv files
 * service: Service classes which are called for web request handling
 * util: Includes helper classes for .csf file and date time handling

*src/main/scala*: Includes test classes and resources (.csv files)
